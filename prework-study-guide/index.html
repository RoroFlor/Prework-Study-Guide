        <h2>HTML</h2> 
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>HTML is made up of elements that help create the structure. Think of HTML as the framework of a house!</li>
          <li>So what are Elements you may ask? Elements are used to divide the content on a webpage and to describe the content to browsers and devolopers</li>
          <li>There are two types of Elements, Child Elements and Parent Elements</li>
          <li>Child Element- Nested inside of other Elements</li>
          <li>Parent Element- Hold the children Elements</li>
          <li>An example: Making an Unordered list(ul) in HTML and coding Listed Items(li) inside of the ul, that would make the ul the parent element and the li the child element </li>
          <li> < >: These angle brackets are used to contain everything we want to include in an element like content and other nested elements.</li>
          <li> < head >: contains info, or metadata, that helps the browser to render correctly. Elements included within the < head > element are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li> < body >: contains the content that is visible to the user</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li> A class attribute allows us to share a css rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
